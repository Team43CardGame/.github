        Explain why this foundational work is necessary.
        What future user stories, features, or non-functional requirements (e.g., performance, scalability) does this work enable?
        Link to the relevant issues if they exist.

        Example:

        This work will enable real-time collaborative video editing.
        Currently, our architecture only supports single-user editing sessions.
        By implementing a new WebSocket-based service for state synchronization, we will unblock the following planned user stories: 
        - #24 
        - #42

        Describe the proposed technical approach at a high level.
        What systems will be changed? What new components will be created?
        Mention any new technologies, libraries, or architectural patterns.

        Example:

        1. Set up a new Node.js service using the `ws` library for WebSocket communication.
        2. Define a JSON-based protocol for synchronizing video editing actions (e.g., trim, add_filter, adjust_volume).
        3. Deploy the service to our Kubernetes staging environment with a dedicated ingress.
        4. Refactor the mobile client's `VideoEditorViewModel` to connect to this new WebSocket endpoint.

        Define specific, technical, and testable conditions that must be met for this enabler to be considered complete.
        These are typically not user-facing scenarios.

        Example:

        - [ ] A new WebSocket service is deployed and reachable in the staging environment.
        - [ ] The mobile client can successfully establish a persistent connection to the service.
        - [ ] Sending a 'trim' action from one connected client is reflected in a second connected client's UI within 200ms.
        - [ ] The existing single-user editing functionality is not regressed by these changes.
        - [ ] Automated integration tests for the new service achieve 85% code coverage.
